Some freaking words about my wow mistake.
I just totally deleted my files in visual code, linked to my local git repo. I think you can understand what can i feel right now.
Yep. Saddness in my eyes.
There did nothing like it was something important. But it my time.
Saaaad. 

Just... watch your steps when you do smth with your repo with git commands.
